# OSOS ↔ ESP32 serial protocol

The bridge sits on the OpenSpand serial header and speaks the **charlierobson
`zxsvr`** protocol (ZXpand-Vitamins/serial-server). The **ZX81 (OSOS) is the
client and drives every exchange**; the ESP only answers verbs. This matches the
ZX81's pull/`FAST`-mode receive (no per-byte flow control needed — the per-block
round-trip is the pacing).

## Link settings

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Baud | 38400 |
| Frame | 8N1 |
| Pins (ESP) | TX = GPIO 34 → OpenSpand serial-in, RX = GPIO 21 ← OpenSpand serial-out |
| Level | TTL (verify 3.3 V; level-shift the ESP RX if the header is 5 V) |

## Verbs (ZX81 → ESP)

| Verb | Args (ZX81 → ESP) | Reply (ESP → ZX81) | Meaning |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `'I'` (0x49) | — | `len_lo, len_hi` | Length of the armed file (2 bytes, little-endian). |
| `'T'` (0x54) | `blockNum, blockLen` | `blockLen data bytes`, then `sum_lo, sum_hi` | One block from offset `blockNum*256`. `blockLen` 0 means 256. Checksum = 16-bit sum of the block's bytes. |
| `'X'` (0x58) | — | — | End of transfer; the ESP reverts to the program slot. |
| `'U'` (0x55) | `verLo, verHi` | `status` (1 byte) | OSOS auto-update query. The ZX81 sends its running version; the ESP replies `1` if a newer `menu.p` is mirrored (and **arms the update slot** for the next `I`/`T`/`X`), else `0`. |
| `'N'` (0x4E) | — | `len`, then `len` bytes | The program slot's filename as **ZX81 char codes**. Sent before a program transfer so the ZX81 can save under the real name; `zxsvr.exe` ignores `'N'` (the ZX81 times out → `INBOX.P`). |
| `'B'` (0x42) | `cmd` | `status` (1 byte) | Browser command: `0`=reload, `1..N`=follow link N, `255`=back. Renders the page into the browse slot and arms it for the next `I`/`T`/`X`. |
| `'G'` (0x47) | `len`, then `len` bytes | `status` (1 byte) | Set the browser URL (ASCII, typed on the ZX81). The ESP fetches+renders and arms the browse slot. |
| `'L'` (0x4C) | `cat, len`, then `len` query bytes | `count` (1 byte) | Library search. `cat` 255 = all categories. The ESP searches the TOSEC catalog (auto-downloading it on first use), renders the matches as a **numbered list** into the browse slot (arming it for the next `I`/`T`/`X`), and remembers the page's catalog indices. Replies the number of results. |
| `'D'` (0x44) | `num` | `status` (1 byte) | Download the `num`-th result of the last `'L'` search: fetch its zip from archive.org, inflate the `.p`, write it to the **program slot** with an 8.3 name, and arm it. Replies `1` on success. Takes a few seconds. |

## Slots

The ESP serves one of three files in LittleFS for the `I`/`T`/`X` pull:

- **program slot** (`/program.p`, default) — the last `.p` uploaded via the web UI. The
  ZX81's `S` key pulls it and saves it under the name from `'N'` (its upload filename,
  persisted in `/program.nam`), falling back to `INBOX.P`.
- **update slot** (`/menu.p`) — the latest OSOS image mirrored from the OpenSpand-OS GitHub
  releases. Armed by `'U'`; the ZX81's `U` key pulls it, saves it as `MENU.P`, and `LOAD`s it.
- **browse slot** (`/browse.txt`) — the rendered web page **or** the library's numbered
  search results. Armed by `'B'`/`'G'` (browser) and `'L'` (library); the ZX81's `B` and `L`
  modes pull and display it. A `'D'` download arms the **program slot** with the game.

After each `'X'` the ESP reverts to the program slot. A bare `zxsvr.exe` / `zxserver.sh` that
only sends `I`/`T`/`X` transfers the program slot unchanged — useful for bench transfers.

## ZX81 side

Implemented in [`OpenSpand-OS`](https://github.com/hbehrensj/OpenSpand-OS) `build_menu.py`:
`RXSER` (the `I`/`T`/`X` pull in `FAST` mode), `UPDQRY`/`NAMEGET` (`'U'`/`'N'` queries),
`BROWSEGO`/`URLSEND` + the `BRENDER`/`KSCAN` browser machine code (`'B'`/`'G'`), and
`LIBSEND`/`LIBGET` for the library (`'L'`/`'D'`) — which reuse the browser's editor and
display loop on the ZX81.
